This repository includes my solutions for the problem sets for [Computational Methods in Nonlinear Optimization (52879)](https://shnaton.huji.ac.il/index.php/NewSyl/52879/2/2022/), a Master's course given at the [Statistics Department, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem](https://en.stat.huji.ac.il/).
The first part of the course focuses on different optimization methods, their complexity, and their stability. 
Later parts of the course focused on dynamic programming, with implications in Finance.
